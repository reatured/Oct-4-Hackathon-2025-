> Empathy-driven, continuous AI care for Alzheimer's patients.

CuraLoop is an AI-powered platform augmented by a **Human-in-the-Loop** model to provide 24/7 continuous care and cognitive health monitoring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It acts as a digital companion, a medical assistant, and a vital data bridge connecting patients, their caregivers, and their doctors.

### The Problem

Alzheimer's symptoms often progress silently between infrequent clinical visits. Current care models rely on subjective, fragmented assessments, which means cognitive decline often goes unnoticed until it becomes severe. This leads to delayed interventions, missed opportunities for improving quality of life, and increased strain on caregivers.

### The Solution

CuraLoop introduces an AI-powered daily companion that continuously tracks, predicts, and supports a patient's cognitive and emotional well-being. Through daily check-ins, gamified cognitive exercises, and natural language conversations, the platform captures subtle behavioral, linguistic, and emotional signals. Our AI algorithms analyze these trends to detect potential deterioration, issuing alerts to doctors or caregivers to enable proactive and early intervention.

## Core Features

*   **üóìÔ∏è Daily Check-Ins:** Establishes a consistent cognitive baseline through simple memory and orientation questions.
*   **üéÆ Gamified Cognitive Training:** AI-adaptive games designed to enhance memory, attention, and orientation while generating quantitative performance data.
*   **üí¨ 24/7 Chat Companion:** An empathetic AI assistant that patients can converse with at any time. The system analyzes language and emotion to identify confusion, depression, or behavioral changes.
*   **üîî Predictive Alert System:** AI models detect negative trends (e.g., declining memory, increased distress) and automatically trigger notifications to caregivers or doctors.
*   **‚öïÔ∏è Human-in-the-Loop Review:** Doctors receive auto-generated risk summaries, allowing them to review AI findings, approve or modify them, and update treatment plans.
*   **ü©∫ Doctor Dashboard:** A centralized dashboard that summarizes cognitive trajectories, emotional trends, and patient logs for efficient reviews.

## AI + Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

Our system creates a continuous feedback loop that ensures both precision and safety:

**User Interaction ‚Üí Data Logging ‚Üí AI Analysis & Clustering ‚Üí Risk Alert ‚Üí Doctor/Caregiver Review ‚Üí Plan Adjustment ‚Üí Continuous Feedback**

This process leverages AI for real-time monitoring and prediction, while human experts provide the critical oversight needed for safety, interpretability, and ethical decision-making.
